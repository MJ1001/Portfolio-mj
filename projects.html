            <p>This is a project I made by learning from DevEd. This project showcases
                creative HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work. It also demonstrates good flexbox
                and grid layouts. It's a composition of 4 different
                pages, highlighting different people with different occupations respectively.

            <p>This was a project made with python. It is a webscraper I built and it 
                would scrape this page for the all the graphic cards, and anytime it noticed
                a price drop in a certain card that I have selected, it would email me with
                the link and also include a little text notifying me that there has been a price drop.
